QUERIES

QUESTION 1
SELECT count(u_id) 
FROM public.users;

QUESTION 2
SELECT count(u_id) 
FROM public.transfers 
WHERE send_amount_currency = 'CFA';

QUESTION 3
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT u_id) 
FROM public.transfers 
WHERE send_amount_currency = 'CFA';

QUESTION 4
SELECT to_char(when_created, 'Month') AS month,
date_trunc('Month', when_created) AS time,
COUNT(atx_id)
FROM public.agent_transactions  
WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM when_created) = 2018  
GROUP BY month, time
ORDER BY time;

QUESTION 5
NOTES
For this question I couldn't create one query code so i broke it down into simpler bits. 
I created a view will total deposits and withdrawals for each agent_id. 
Then I created another view where I subtracted deposits from withdraws to create a new column agent net_transactions. 
Then I queried the view to count positive net_trasctions which will represent net depositor and one to query negative net_transactions which will be net withdraws.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW agent_total_expense AS
SELECT agent_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN amount > 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS sum_of_deposits,
       SUM(CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN -amount ELSE 0 END) AS sum_of_withdrawals
FROM public.agent_transactions
WHERE when_created BETWEEN now() - interval '7 days' AND now()
GROUP BY agent_id;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW net_transactions AS
SELECT agent_id,
sum_of_deposits - sum_of_withdrawals AS net_trans
FROM agent_total_expense;

SELECT COUNT(agent_id)
FROM net_transactions
WHERE net_trans >= 0; // CHANGE THE SIGN TO GREATER THAN OR LESS THAN TO GET NET DEPOSITORS OR NET WITHDRAWERS

QUESTION 6
// NUMBER OF TRANSFER
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW atx_volume_city_summary AS 
SELECT 
city, 
COUNT(agent_transactions.agent_id)
FROM public.agent_transactions
INNER JOIN public.agents
ON agent_transactions.agent_id = agents.agent_id
WHERE agent_transactions.when_created BETWEEN now() - interval '7 days' AND now()
GROUP BY city;

// AMOUNT TRANSFERRED
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW atx_volume_city_summary AS
SELECT city,
SUM(agent_transactions.amount)
FROM public.agent_transactions
INNER JOIN public.agents
ON agent_transactions.agent_id = agents.agent_id
WHERE agent_transactions.when_created BETWEEN now() - interval '7 days' AND now()
GROUP BY city;


QUESTION 7
// NUMBER OF TRANSFER
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW atx_volume_city_summary AS 
SELECT
country,
city,
COUNT(agent_transactions.agent_id)
FROM public.agent_transactions
INNER JOIN public.agents
ON agent_transactions.agent_id = agents.agent_id
WHERE agent_transactions.when_created BETWEEN now() - interval '7 days' AND now()
GROUP BY country, city;

// AMOUNT TRANSFERRED
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW atx_volume_city_summary AS 
SELECT

city,
SUM(agent_transactions.amount)
FROM public.agent_transactions
INNER JOIN public.agents
ON agent_transactions.agent_id = agents.agent_id
WHERE agent_transactions.when_created BETWEEN now() - interval '7 days' AND now()
GROUP BY country, city;

QUESTION 8
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW send_volume_by_country_and_kind AS 
SELECT 
ledger_location,
kind,
SUM(send_amount_scalar)
FROM public.transfers
INNER JOIN public.wallets
ON source_wallet_id = wallet_id
WHERE transfers.when_created 
BETWEEN now() - interval '7 days' AND now()
GROUP BY ledger_location , kind;

QUESTION 9
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW send_volume_by_country_and_kind_with_Count AS 
SELECT 
ledger_location,
kind,
SUM(send_amount_scalar),
COUNT(DISTINCT u_id) AS number_of_unique_senders,
COUNT(transfer_id) AS transaction_count
FROM public.transfers
INNER JOIN public.wallets
ON source_wallet_id = wallet_id
WHERE transfers.when_created 
BETWEEN now() - interval '7 days' AND now()
GROUP BY ledger_location , kind;

Question 10
SELECT source_wallet_id, SUM(send_amount_scalar)
FROM public.transfers
WHERE  transfers.send_amount_currency = 'CFA' AND transfers.when_created 
BETWEEN now() - interval '1 month' AND now()
GROUP BY source_wallet_id
HAVING SUM(send_amount_scalar) > 10000000
